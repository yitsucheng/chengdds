You are attending a wedding or important dinner and meet someone new, but you\u2019re afraid to speak because you\u2019re afraid your breath may stink. Even if you are diligent about flossing, brushing and using mouthwash, you wonder if it\u2019s enough.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Almost 25% of people suffer from the embarrassing condition of bad breath. Causes range from dry mouth to dental issues, to systemic diseases like diabetes. In fact, did you know the incredibly popular Keto Diet often results in terrible breath?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So what can you do to ensure you have fresh breath at your next night out or special event? We rounded up some helpful ideas, particularly for those events that include a meal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>3 Ways to Make Sure Your Breath is Date Night Fresh<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1: Prep Before the meal<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course, brushing your teeth can help prevent bad breath, but you can take it a few steps further. After brushing your teeth, make sure you clean your tongue.\u00a0 Brushing your tongue makes sure bacteria doesn\u2019t build up, causing bad breath. You could also try a tongue scraper for this job.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another idea is to take an antacid before you start eating. You may be used to doing this after eating, to help alleviate any antacid or food intolerance, but doing it beforehand can reduce odors in your mouth, and prevent gas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2: Choose your food carefully<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Certain foods bring with it additional risks for bad breath. And some things found on the menu may help prevent it Try incorporating a probiotic, commonly found in yogurt and sourdough into your meal. (You could also add a supplement to your daily routine.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another good choice would be food with lots of Vitamin C. Green peppers, citrus, and kiwi can help with fresh breath. Citric acid makes your salivary glands work well, eliminating that stinky bacteria.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You probably already guessed that avoiding garlic is a good idea, but you should also add onion to that list. They both have great anti-inflammatory benefits, but they aren\u2019t going to do you any favors in the fresh breath department.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3: After the meal care<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Flossing after a meal will ensure anything stuck between your teeth is removed, preventing bacteria from spreading. Old food and newly eaten food can have a lethal effect on your breath! Keep some minty floss in your purse and sneak into the bathroom to do this after the meal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to pop in a stick of gum after eating. Sugarless and peppermint flavor would be the best option. It\u2019s an easy thing to carry and can quickly help freshen up your breath if you can\u2019t brush right away.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Overall, drinking water throughout the day and the event will help keep your mouth clean and your breath fresh.<a href=\"https:\/\/dev.chengdds.com\/\"><strong> If you think your bad breath may be due to some dental issues, please call our office to schedule an appointment today<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy September!
