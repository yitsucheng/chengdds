It\u2019s one of my favorite times of the year! But unfortunately, if you are like many people this time of year is loaded with ALL the nasty germs that can ruin your holiday fun. What you probably may NOT realize, is that your oral hygiene often plays a factor in how often (and how long) you stay sick.<\/p>\n<p>So to help you get through this holiday season with as few coughs and sneezes as possible, I\u2019ve put together tips for surviving this cold and flu season.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>6 Dental Tips for Surviving Cold &amp; Flu Season<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip #1: Ditch the Toothbrush<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your toothbrush is probably the last thing on your mind when you get sick. But the truth is, that it can be a breeding ground for bacteria and germs. Once you start feeling better, you\u2019re best to toss it in the trash to avoid getting reinfected with the illness.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip #2: Eat Your Fruits &amp; Veggies<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I know, Mom was right. Eating your fruits and veggies isn\u2019t just a smart choice from a caloric standpoint, they are full of helpful vitamins and nutrients. The bonus is that foods such as apples and carrots also help keep your mouth clean by rubbing against your teeth while chewing. It\u2019s win-win.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip#3:<\/strong> <strong>Use Salt Water as Mouth Rinse<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While you may love your Colgate mouthwash, rinsing and gargling with salt water helps remove that nasty bacteria and help prevent bad breath which could ruin your up close conversations during the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip #4:<\/strong> <strong>Up Your Fluid Intake<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t stress drinking water enough. When trying to prevent the cold and flu from taking root in your body, It is super important to keep your fluid levels up. Drinking water helps with hydration and saliva production. This will in turn help keep bacteria at bay and fight off illnesses that may take hold faster.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip #5: Avoid Sugary Medicines<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I personally LOVE cough drops, but sadly have to watch how often I rely on them. Sugary medications can cause tooth decay and further increase the number of places those icky germs can hide out and breed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip #6: Don\u2019t Skip Brushing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While you should be brushing and flossing 2x a day anyway, it\u2019s especially important during cold and flu season. Proper routine care helps keep bacteria in check and reduces the risk of tooth decay which we already know can create a hotbed of illness.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully you won\u2019t need to use the tips above (nobody has time to be sick!)
