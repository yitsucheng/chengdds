As of late, our office hours have been very limited, with the main focus being on seeing major dental emergencies. Rest assured, we are carefully following all of the guidelines put forth by the CDC when seeing patients. It is our hope that this period of uncertainty will soon pass and we will be back to our normal business operations. At this point, we have decided to gradually see patients for selective dental procedures starting May 4th.<\/p>\n<p>We have always practiced very careful hygienic protocols in our office but with the current climate, we are taking additional precautions to protect our patients and team.<\/p>\n<p>What are we doing for our patients?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>We are asking that all patients who exhibit any flu-like symptoms, have travelled outside the United States, or have been in contact with any sick individuals to reschedule their appointment(s) for at least 2 weeks.<\/li>\n<li>We are providing hand sanitizer for all patients to use when they arrive at the office.<\/li>\n<li>Every patient is checked-in and checked-out separately in order to reduce unnecessary contact and follow social distancing protocols.<\/li>\n<li>We added more equipment (disposable clinic jackets, screen thermometer, UV light, air filters, etc.) to create a safer environment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>At Yi-Tsu Cheng, DDS and Associates, your health and wellness have been and will continue to be our highest priority.
