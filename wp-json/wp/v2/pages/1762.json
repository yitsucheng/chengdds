On July 31, 2012, Brookhaven was approved in a referendum to become DeKalb County&#8217;s 11th city. Incorporation officially took place on December 17, 2012, on which date municipal operations commenced. With a population of around 49,000, it is the largest city in DeKalb County. The new city stretches over 12 square miles.<\/p>\n<p>Brookhaven&#8217;s first permanent European settler was John Evins, who started a plantation around 1810. Harris and Solomon Goodwin, who moved to Georgia from South Carolina, became owners of the land in the 1830s. The Goodwin home and the family graveyard have been preserved at the 3900 block of Peachtree Road, near Dresden Drive. A train station known as Goodwin&#8217;s was constructed along the Atlanta and Richmond (later Atlanta and Charlotte) railway in 1873.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d106004.77796068024!2d-84.39886910849584!3d33.87292762145779!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88f5089505f9f565%3A0x851a6587d0c37ec1!2sBrookhaven%2C+GA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1534017524629\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d52996.93671559611!2d-84.34349954982875!3d33.881706654184!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e6!4m5!1s0x88f5089505f9f565%3A0x851a6587d0c37ec1!2sBrookhaven%2C+GA!3m2!1d33.8651033!2d-84.3365917!4m5!1s0x88f509cb3f7518b3%3A0xbb9e47f4984ea009!2sYi-Tsu+Cheng%2C+D.D.S.+%26+Associates%2C+Buford+Highway+Northeast+Ste.+B%2C+Chamblee%2C+GA!3m2!1d33.888563!2d-84.2870739!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1534017574162\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><br \/>\nLearn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.chengdds.com\/areas-served\/cumming-ga\">Cumming GA<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] About Brookhaven GA Brookhaven is a city in the northeastern suburbs of Atlanta and is located in western DeKalb County, Georgia, United States, directly northeast of Atlanta.
