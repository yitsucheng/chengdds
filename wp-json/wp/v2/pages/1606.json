Atlanta is the seat of Fulton County and a small portion of the city extends eastward into DeKalb County.<\/p>\n<p>In 1837, Atlanta was founded at the intersection of two railroad lines, and the city rose from the ashes of the American Civil War to become a national center of commerce. In the decades following the Civil Rights Movement, the city earned a reputation as &#8220;too busy to hate&#8221; for the relatively progressive views of its citizens and leaders compared to other cities in the Deep South. Atlanta attained international prominence, and it became the primary transportation hub of the Southeastern United States, via highway, railroad, and air, with Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport being the world&#8217;s busiest airport since 1998.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d212270.03409688894!2d-84.56069131928172!3d33.767919196407014!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88f5045d6993098d%3A0x66fede2f990b630b!2sAtlanta%2C+GA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1534014823146\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d106063.44758190027!2d-84.4030278511957!3d33.825659365518725!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e6!4m5!1s0x88f5045d6993098d%3A0x66fede2f990b630b!2sAtlanta%2C+Georgia!3m2!1d33.7489954!2d-84.3879824!4m5!1s0x88f509cb3f7518b3%3A0xbb9e47f4984ea009!2sYi-Tsu+Cheng%2C+D.D.S.+%26+Associates%2C+5008+Buford+Hwy+NE+Ste.+B%2C+Chamblee%2C+GA+30341!3m2!1d33.888563!2d-84.2870739!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1508217630311\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/dev.chengdds.com\/areas-served\/doraville-georgia\">Click here<\/a> to know more about Doraville GA.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] About Atlanta GA Atlanta is the capital of and the most populous city in the U.S. state of Georgia, with an estimated 2016 population of 472,522.
