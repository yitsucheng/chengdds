The municipality is northeast of Atlanta. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 8,330.<\/p>\n<p>Doraville contains a large stock of mid-century modern houses, arguably the largest concentration in metropolitan Atlanta. Mid-century architecture was frequently employed in residential structures with the goal of bringing modernism into suburbs developed in the era immediately following World War II, which is when the majority of homes in Doraville were constructed. This style emphasized creating structures with ample windows and open floor plans, with the intention of opening up interior spaces and bringing the outdoors in. Many mid-century houses utilized then-groundbreaking post and beam architectural design that eliminated bulky support walls in favor of walls seemingly made of glass. Function was as important as form in mid-century designs, with an emphasis placed specifically on targeting the needs of the average American family. While the style is seen throughout Doraville, the Northwoods and Northcrest neighborhoods are the most well-preserved mid-century modern neighborhoods in the city. In Northcrest, over half of the homes are mid-century moderns, while Northwoods is one of only three surviving mid-century planned communities in Georgia<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d52981.60776485644!2d-84.29951174964256!3d33.90637803183095!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88f509de65ff0453%3A0x71eaf98ba9d2df9b!2sDoraville%2C+GA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1534016309957\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d13247.078979869615!2d-84.291146225768!3d33.89558345152568!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e6!4m5!1s0x88f509de65ff0453%3A0x71eaf98ba9d2df9b!2sDoraville%2C+GA!3m2!1d33.8981579!2d-84.2832564!4m5!1s0x88f509cb3f7518b3%3A0xbb9e47f4984ea009!2sYi-Tsu+Cheng%2C+D.D.S.+%26+Associates%2C+Buford+Highway+Northeast+Ste.+B%2C+Chamblee%2C+GA!3m2!1d33.888563!2d-84.2870739!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1534016333174\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.chengdds.com\/areas-served\/peachtree-corners-ga\">Learn more<\/a> about Peachtree Corners GA.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] About Doraville GA Doraville is a city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States.
