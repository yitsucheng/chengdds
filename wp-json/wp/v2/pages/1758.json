It is a northern suburb of Atlanta. Dunwoody was incorporated as a city on December 1, 2008. As of 2015, the city has a population of 48,733, up from 46,267 in the 2010 Census.<\/p>\n<p>The Dunwoody area was established in the early 1830s and is named for Major Charles Dunwody (1828\u20131905), an extra &#8220;o&#8221; added with the incorrect spelling of the name on a banking note. Charles Dunwody originally returned to Roswell after fighting in the Civil War, in which he fought for the secession of the Confederate states.<\/p>\n<p>Dunwoody Village is the historic heart of the community, and the location of the iconic Dunwoody Farmhouse. The distinctive Colonial Williamsburg architectural style of the district originated with the construction of Dunwoody Village Shopping Center in the 1970s, for which the district gets its name. Since then, all other construction in the area followed suit, giving Dunwoody a unique architectural identity and sense of place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d52958.774997416294!2d-84.34154704936522!3d33.943097248544525!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x88f501c8e441abf1%3A0xd5bc1b3259441b11!2sDunwoody%2C+GA!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1534017242099\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d52974.69287311684!2d-84.33878484955859!3d33.91750212174906!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e6!4m5!1s0x88f501c8e441abf1%3A0xd5bc1b3259441b11!2sDunwoody%2C+GA!3m2!1d33.9462125!2d-84.3346473!4m5!1s0x88f509cb3f7518b3%3A0xbb9e47f4984ea009!2sYi-Tsu+Cheng%2C+D.D.S.+%26+Associates%2C+Buford+Highway+Northeast+Ste.+B%2C+Chamblee%2C+GA!3m2!1d33.888563!2d-84.2870739!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1534017206399\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/dev.chengdds.com\/areas-served\/brookhaven-ga\">Click here to know more about Brookhaven GA<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] About Dunwoody GA Dunwoody is a city located in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States.
