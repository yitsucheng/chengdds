You need to prepare yourself for possible emergencies by locating a good dentist before they are needed. Your oral hygiene may lie in the preventative measures taken by a reputable dentist and you should be well armed to find one as you read on.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, all dentists are required to attend a dental school and become licensed; however this does not mean they are necessarily experienced. This is something you can research before choosing a dentist. Things to check out may include where they went to school and how long they have been treating patients. You could check out whether or not they have anything to do with established dental groups or societies. Usually, a dentist will use their accreditation with other agencies to promote their practice through their ads. Things like awards, certificates and such will probably be shown in their office. Even though these are great for reference, you still need to dig a little deeper in to their credits. Where a dentist is located certainly can make a difference, but should not be the only consideration. It would be great if your dentist was in a handy location and close to home; however this is not what you ought to base your decision on. Having a dentist nearby when you have an emergency situation is ideal. Believe it or not, the area in which a dentist has his office can have an effect on their prices. Of course you wish to have a dentist that is fully capable and you feel good about; along with finding a suitable location.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re searching for a dentist, you can use the internet to help you. Even though your best bet is to get personal recommendations, you can&#8217;t always do this, particularly if you are new to an area. When you are looking online, you&#8217;ll find all sorts of dentist&#8217;s websites and these websites can be quite useful in getting a good first impression. A good looking website, though, might only mean that the dentist hired a good web designer. Make sure to seek out testimonials as well as verifiable information about the dentist&#8217;s credentials. Another good place to try to find really good information about dentists is Angie&#8217;s List which houses a lot of independent customer reviews for all sorts of professionals like dentists and doctors.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully you are now better prepared to make a logical choice when you think you have found the right dentist. After taking adequate time to research the dentists in your area, you should be able to come up with a suitable one. The best dentist will have a caring attitude and give you the consideration that will may you feel at home. Simply take the time to do your research and make a wise decision when you are ready.[\/vc_column_text][vc_video link=&#8221;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BcTpy9fuf5M&#8221; align=&#8221;center&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1507698153271{border-radius: 1px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Dental Clinic is located at Stone Mountain GA area.<\/h2>\n<p>We are currently accepting new patients, and you can schedule an appointment by calling 770-457-3671.[\/vc_column_text][vc_video link=&#8221;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8_XptadHVuA&#8221; align=&#8221;center&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1492196623512{border-radius: 1px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>About Stone Mountain GA<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Yi-Tsu+Cheng,+D.D.S.+%26+Associates\/@33.8885674,-84.2892626,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88f509cb3f7518b3:0xbb9e47f4984ea009!8m2!3d33.888563!4d-84.2870739?hl=en\">Stone Mountain<\/a> is a quartz monzonite dome monadnock and the site of Stone Mountain Park in Stone Mountain, Georgia. At its summit, the elevation is 1,686 feet (514 m) MSL and 825 feet (251 m) above the surrounding area. Stone Mountain is well-known not only for its geology, but also for the enormous rock relief on its north face, the largest bas-relief in the world. The carving depicts three Confederate figures during the Civil War: Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.<\/p>\n<p>Stone Mountain was once owned by the Venable Brothers and was the site of the founding of the second Ku Klux Klan in 1915. It was purchased by the State of Georgia in 1958.<\/p>\n<p>Stone Mountain is more than 5 miles (8 km) in circumference at its base. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a walk-up trail on the west side of the mountain or by the Skyride aerial tram.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d106044.17835496532!2d-84.29766465085204!3d33.84119038517823!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e6!4m5!1s0x88f5af24c25d5bbb%3A0x4119e5c541409adc!2sStone+Mountain%2C+Georgia!3m2!1d33.808160799999996!2d-84.17019599999999!4m5!1s0x88f509cb3f7518b3%3A0xbb9e47f4984ea009!2sYi-Tsu+Cheng%2C+D.D.S.+%26+Associates%2C+5008+Buford+Hwy+NE+Ste.+B%2C+Chamblee%2C+GA+30341!3m2!1d33.888563!2d-84.2870739!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1508300741878\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1440049113495{margin-bottom: 70px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Our Services&#8221;
