Your overall health can be affected by your teeth and gums, and a toothache that is painful shows this quite easily. Choosing the right dentist will help you keep your mouth in good shape, so we are giving you these valuable tips.<\/p>\n<p>If you are seeking out a new dentist, make sure you visit at least a few offices in the same area. When the office is a large one you might only get to talk to the front office staff, but you can still learn quite a lot from this. You may, however, prefer a smaller practice where you can meet the dentist personally. The best way to try out a dentist is to schedule yourself for a checkup and a cleaning. Doing this allows you to see how comfortable you feel both with the dentist and with the office as a whole. Sometimes people won&#8217;t seek out a dentist until they start to show severe problems like toothaches. This means that you will be forced to find a dentist that has an opening in the near future. When it&#8217;s possible, though, you need to choose a dentist before you are faced with an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a dentist, you&#8217;ll probably notice that many dentists do a lot of advertising. You will see these ads in such places as the internet, local business directories and of course the local newspaper. While you can use ads as a way to inform you about which dentists are practicing in your area, you shouldn&#8217;t rely entirely on advertising to choose a dentist. A dentist listing too many ads could inadvertently be saying his practice is having trouble keeping patients. When a dentist is highly recommended, you will not likely have a good chance of getting in to see them without first being place on a very long waiting list, but it can be worth the wait. Over advertising is not necessarily a bad sign, but it should make you wonder a little.<\/p>\n<p>Be prepared to have the way your dentist runs his office a little different from the last one you visited; they all differ slightly. When checking out some of the local dentists; remember you should be welcomed into their office, without a lot undue grief. If a dentist is very good, he may also be so busy that it&#8217;s hard to make an appointment. Check into the daily or weekend hours that the dentists&#8217; office is open for business or emergencies. Inquire as to the waiting time for a general check up, or teeth cleaning? You should also inquire about any policies for receiving emergency care during off hours. These are all factors to consider, as you should find a dentist who has hours and policies that are convenient for you. It&#8217;s best to try to find a dentist that you will be able to visit for all of your dental issues for years to come. It&#8217;s best to spend some time researching a variety of dentists than picking one at random. You will be much better off if you start trying to find a dentist when you are not suffering from any serious or emergency like problems so that you will have time to make a well thought out decision.[\/vc_column_text][vc_video link=&#8221;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BcTpy9fuf5M&#8221; align=&#8221;center&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1507698153271{border-radius: 1px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Dental Clinic is located at Avondale Estates GA area.<\/h2>\n<p>We are currently accepting new patients, and you can schedule an appointment by calling 770-457-3671.[\/vc_column_text][vc_video link=&#8221;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8_XptadHVuA&#8221; align=&#8221;center&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1492196623512{border-radius: 1px !important;}&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>About Avondale Estates GA<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Yi-Tsu+Cheng,+D.D.S.+%26+Associates\/@33.8885674,-84.2892626,17z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88f509cb3f7518b3:0xbb9e47f4984ea009!8m2!3d33.888563!4d-84.2870739?hl=en\">Avondale Estates<\/a> is a city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The population was 2,960 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area and is near Decatur.<\/p>\n<p>Avondale Estates was founded in 1924 by George Francis Willis, a patent medicine magnate, who purchased the entire village of Ingleside to create a planned community. The city was named after Stratford-upon-Avon, England, birthplace of Shakespeare. Downtown buildings were designed in a Tudor style to reinforce this image, as were many of the houses in the city. Community amenities such as a lake, tennis courts, a clubhouse, parks, and a swimming pool were built for residents.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d106048.63138931169!2d-84.33855780093144!3d33.83760179218911!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e6!4m5!1s0x88f5a9e89e070153%3A0x393f6879979608ac!2sAvondale+Estates%2C+Georgia!3m2!1d33.771493899999996!2d-84.26714439999999!4m5!1s0x88f509cb3f7518b3%3A0xbb9e47f4984ea009!2sYi-Tsu+Cheng%2C+D.D.S.+%26+Associates%2C+5008+Buford+Hwy+NE+Ste.+B%2C+Chamblee%2C+GA+30341!3m2!1d33.888563!2d-84.2870739!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1508293492065\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1440049113495{margin-bottom: 70px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Our Services&#8221;
